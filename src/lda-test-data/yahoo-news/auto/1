Man Who Intentionally Drove Bugatti Veyron Into Lake Sentenced To Prison

In October 2009, Andy House purchased a Bugatti Veyron for $1 million. He insured his new vehicle for $2.2 million, and just a month later, drove the 1,000 horsepower hypercar into a lake. If that all sounds suspicious, it was. And, thanks to a video of the incident appearing on YouTube, it forced House to plead guilty to wire fraud and face 20 years behind bars.

But as we¡¯ve just learned, he didn¡¯t receive a sentence even close to that.

Six years after the original incident, Judge Michael Schneider of the Lufkin Federal Courthouse in Texas issued a 12 month and one day jail sentence, with three years of supervised release tacked onto the end. According to KTRE, House must also pay back Philadelphia Indemnity the settlement he won in October 2012, a figure the court revealed to be $600,000.

Back in 2009, House left the engine running after purposely driving into the lake, effectively killing the car (he later claimed the reason for not turning it off was because he was being bitten by mosquitoes). The following day, House then called up his insurance company and placed a claim for the full $2.2 million, telling authorities that he was reaching for his cell phone when he veered across the lane and became startled by a pelican, crashing directly into the Gulf Bay lake near La Marque, Texas. What House didn¡¯t realize was a passing driver videoed the entire incident. That video, shown below featuring strong language, was ultimately imperative in disproving House¡¯s claims.


Prior to driving into a lake, House had reportedly attempted to bribe someone to steal his Veyron and set it on fire. Even if he had opted for this original plan, it¡¯s doubtful the outcome revealed this week would have differed much.
