How Cuba¡¯s ¡°Yank Tanks¡± Keep Rolling

It¡¯s one thing for experts to explain why Cuba¡¯s stash of pre-1962 American cars may not be appealing outside the country. It¡¯s quite another to see them in action, up close, as Cubans use them in their daily lives. 

As Yahoo Studios captured on a recent trip to the island, these pieces of old Detroit iron don¡¯t get treated much better than a taxicab in any other part of the world. And between the Cuban government¡¯s strict restrictions on private vehicle ownership, and the lack of replacement parts, most of the old vehicles around Havana have few if any original pieces; they¡¯re more likely to be powered by coughing Russian diesels than their original V-8s.

And yet, they still manage to evoke the spirit of a pre-revolutionary Cuba, one that more American tourists will experience in the upcoming year. Check out the video to see what riding in a Cuban time capsule feels like.
