This Might Be The Best Drifting Video You¡¯ve Seen All Year

Ken Block might hold the title for pioneering insanely viral automotive drift videos, but that doesn¡¯t mean others aren¡¯t equally as competent. As this latest one from Monster Energy shows¡ªfeaturing Vaughn Gittin Jr. in his 550 horsepower Mustang RTR and Daigo Saito¡¯s 650 horsepower V-12 Lambo¡ªBlock may have his work cut out to top this particular drift battle.

It¡¯s not the V-12 Lamborghini versus the V-8 Mustang that intrigues, nor is it the abandoned Russian village in which the duel takes place. The key to this video is its production value, which is¡ªlegitimately¡ªsome of the best we¡¯ve seen. (Check out the transition between day to night at 3:10!)

In all honesty, videos of cars drifting around mountain roads, super-slow mo¡¯s capturing the action, have become stale¡ªthey¡¯re all basically doing the same pointless thing. While it¡¯s tough to discern what makes this particular video so epic, after watching it, the fact that it is remains undeniable.
