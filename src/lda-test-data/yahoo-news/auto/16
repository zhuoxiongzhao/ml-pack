Santamobiles: Top 5 Cars in St. Nick¡¯s Garage

We¡¯d like to think that Jolly Old St. Nick spends a decent amount of time in his garage the other 364 days out of the year. And while the contents of said North Pole garage are a closely held secret, here are five cars that we think the man with the bag shouldn¡¯t be without:

1. C7 Chevrolet Corvette Z06: Santa has to cover a lot of ground in very little time, hence the new Corvette Z06. It was a tossup between the Vette and a new Hellcat Charger, but in truth, we just can¡¯t see Santa being naughty enough to own something called a ¡°Hellcat.¡±


2. Tucker 48: Should the reindeer ever go on strike, we think that Santa should bust out the Tucker. With its third Rudolph-like center headlight, it would have no trouble lighting Santa¡¯s way.


3. Jeep Grand Wagoneer: Santa needs room (for his own girth and the presents), and he lives at the North Pole. What could be better than a classic all-wheel-drive Jeep Grand Wagoneer?


4. Austin-Healey Bugeye Sprite: Humans don¡¯t get any jollier than St. Nick, and cars don¡¯t get any more gleeful than a smiling Bugeye Sprite. If Santa can fit down a chimney, he can sure as heck squeeze into one of these.
