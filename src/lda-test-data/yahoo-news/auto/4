New Acura NSX Starts At $157,800

The 2017 Acura NSX boasts the title as one of the most-talked about vehicles in years; in part because we¡¯d been teased by the prospect of it since 2007. That initial plan for an Acura supercar fell through along with the economy, and it wasn¡¯t until 2012 that an NSX concept first graced the show halls at Detroit. 

Fast forward to February 25, 2016; the day dealers will finally begin taking orders for the new NSX, with Acura revealing a $157,800 starting price for its 573 horsepower hybrid sports car, with a fully-loaded model topping out at $207,500. 

That¡¯s roughly in-line with the Porsche 911 Turbo and Audi R8, and a hair more than the Mercedes-AMG GT S. Compared to the BMW i8, which is its closest rival in terms of hybrid technology aimed at the mass sports car market, it arrives with a $16,000 premium, despite only boasting aluminum construction rather than the i8¡äs carbon-fiber. On the other hand, the NSX is vastly more powerful.

That horsepower derives from a 500-hp 3.5-liter V-6 turning the rear wheels; a 47-hp electric motor/generator links to the 9-speed transmission, and a twin-electric motor setup powers the front wheels. The torque-vectoring provided by the all-wheel-drive system is quite advanced, and can change the handling characteristics of the car at the touch of button. 

Initial reviews of the new NSX have been mixed. Reviewers appreciate the technical innovation, but it¡¯s not the screaming supercar many hoped it would be. Instead, the NSX is quiet and soft¡ªmore of a GT cruiser than a cornering maestro. Whether it truly lives up to the original NSX moniker, a car Ayrton Senna helped develop in his loafers, is still up for debate. But should you desire the distinction of owning VIN 001, the first 2017 Acura NSX will be heading to Barrett Jackson¡¯s Scottsdale auction in January.
