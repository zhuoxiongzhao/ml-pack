Extremely Rare 3-Wheeled British Motorcycle Heads to Bonhams Auction

We¡¯re pretty confident in saying this one of the rarest motorcycles we¡¯ve ever heard of. It is called the Brough Superior Austin Four, and we can¡¯t call it ¡°the rarest we¡¯ve ever seen,¡± because frankly none of us have actually seen one of these incredible bikes in person. This April, one lucky, wealthy buyer will make this bike a part of their personal collection.

Built from 1932 to 1934 by Brough Superior of Nottingham, U.K., the Austin Four was so-named because of its use of four-cylinder, water-cooled engine from an Austin 7 automobile. The 797cc engine sent power through an Austin 7 gearbox to a pair of rear wheels. The twin rear-wheel setup was designed for sidecar use, as shown below.

The Austin Four was designed to be more of a casual cruiser at the height of the Great Depression¡ªnot an ideal time to offer a luxury toy like an exotic sidecar-motorcycle. In 1932, you could buy an actual Austin 7 car for ¡ê27 less. So only ten of these motorcycles we¡¯re built.

Of the ten, only eight we¡¯re thought to have survived, but then another bike was found near Cornwall. This is one of the other remaining bikes, having been discovered in a barn in Bodmin, Devon.
