The Exact Amount of Every Skin Care Product You Should Apply to Your Face

With so many different steps in your skin-care routine, it can be seriously confusing to figure out just how much of each product you really need to use. (Is that teeny tiny bit of eye cream really enough to blast away dark circles?!) Here, a top derm shares exactly how much face wash, serum, and more you need for the best results. 

You love this refreshing first step¡ªespecially after a long day. But it¡¯s best to stay on the conservative side, as using too much can leave your skin dry, tight, and uncomfortable. A dime-sized blob is your best bet, says Joel Schlessinger, M.D., board-certified dermatologist and RealSelf.com advisor. ¡°For most cream and gel cleansers, this is usually enough to cleanse the skin fully,¡± he says. A fan of the foam kind? One pump should get the job done. 

It¡¯s harder to decipher a set amount¡ªmainly because of how it¡¯s administered. Toner, which rids the skin of dirt and grime, is certainly not the type of product you can slowly squeeze out into your hand¡ªafter all, it¡¯s usually the consistency of vinegar. ¡°Stick to just a few drops, and always apply it with a cotton round,¡± says Schlessinger. ¡°You want the round to be wet but not completely saturated, which would mean less product is absorbed.¡±
