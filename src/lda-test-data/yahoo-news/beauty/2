Miss Philippines Crowned Miss Universe After Steve Harvey Wrongly Named Colombia Winner

Miss Philippines, Pia Alonzo Wurtzbach, was crowned Miss Universe 2015 at Planet Hollywood in Las Vegas on Sunday night ¡ª after host Steve Harvey wrongly named Miss Colombia the winner. The outgoing Miss Universe, Paulina Vega, had already placed the crown on Ariadna Gutierrez Ar¨¦valo's head when Harvey realized his mistake. 

Wurtzbach looked visibly shocked once she learned she was the rightful winner.

"Listen folks... this is exactly what's on the card," Harvey said, showing the card to the camera, after returning to stage during Miss Colombia's bows. "I will take responsibility for this. It was on the card."

The entire awkward moment was caught on-air during the live telecast.

"Please don't hold it against the ladies, we feel so badly," added Harvey, "but it's still a great night." 

Harvey then took to Twitter to apologize for the mortifying gaffe:

The Miss Universe Organization released a statement on the incident shortly after the broadcast. "Unfortunately, a live telecast means human error can come into play. We witnessed that tonight when the wrong winner was initially announced," the statement read in part. The organization also tweeted a video of Miss Colombia, who appeared to be taking the blunder in stride. "Everything happens for a reason," Ar¨¦valo said with a smile, though she was wiping away tears.

The contestants battled it out in swimsuit, evening gown and a particularly grueling final question portion. The top five contestants were each asked a single question, with topics ranging from gun control, terrorism, legalizing marijuana to how to fight drug addiction.
