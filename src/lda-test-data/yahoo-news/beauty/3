A Look Back at the 2015 Instagram Hair Dye Trends

2015 was the year that dyeing your hair and celebrating it on Instagram became a social media phenomenon. Savvy and talented colorists became online celebrities with hundreds of thousands of followers, and hashtags like #UnicornHair and #GrannyHairDontCare went viral, warranting press coverage on their own. ¡°This year was the year of vibrant color,¡± Lucille Javier, colorist at Manhattan-based salon Sally Hershberger Downtown (and my personal colorist) told Yahoo Beauty. ¡°People in different fields, like doctors and models and artists, have been way more accepting of rainbow hair, and I¡¯ve put a lot of effort into making it work-appropriate.¡± Younger women embraced silver hair, and older women embraced pink highlights.

One reason that extreme hair dyes that require double processing are becoming a widespread practice is due to Olaplex, Javier says. Olaplex is a color additive that eliminates the harmful oxygen has with broken sulfite bonds when hair is chemically treated. ¡°People think Olaplex makes you go blonde, but that¡¯s not true,¡± Javier explains. ¡°It makes your hair stronger without making it lighter.¡± Unless, of course, you do want to go blonder ¡ª that¡¯s between your and your colorist.

Celebrities, from Kelly Ripa¡¯s pink tips to Kylie Jenner¡¯s mermaid locks, have also embraced the radical hair dye trend this year, and unlike hair trends of previous years, celebrities seemed to be copying non-celebrities on social media ¡ª not vice versa. ¡°You can inspire people on Instagram,¡± Javier says. You don¡¯t need paparazzi following you to start a hair revolution anymore.

It¡¯s not too late to join in on the Instagram-friendly hair color trend ¡ª check out the past 12 months of #RadHairDontCare for inspiration in 2016.
