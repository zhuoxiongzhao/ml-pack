Keep healthy during the holidays with this guilt-free eggnog. Traditional eggnog is full of dairy and sugar, and these ingredients can often cause bloating and skin problems. This recipe uses our favorite go-to dairy substitutes, almond milk and coconut milk. Cinnamon fights inflammation. The full fat of the coconut milk will help you stay fuller longer, leaving you less likely to graze on other treats!

2 cups almond milk
1 can coconut milk
1 vanilla bean, scraped
? teaspoon grated nutmeg
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
4 egg yolks
? cup coconut sugar
Bourbon, optional
Yields: 6 servings

Heat almond milk, coconut milk, vanilla bean scrapings, nutmeg, and cinnamon in a medium saucepan. Whisk egg yolks and coconut sugar in a bowl. When liquid comes to a simmer, slowly whisk in one cup of the liquid mixture into the egg mixture. Pour the egg mixture into the liquid mixture and whisk over medium heat for three minutes or until the mixture is thick. Serve immediately.
