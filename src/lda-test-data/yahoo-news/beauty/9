The World¡¯s Coolest Vacations

These destinations will give you the chills¡ªin more ways than one.

As the colder weather quickly approaches, many of us plan winter vacations to tropical destinations as a short, sunny reprieve during those few brutal months. But, why not embrace the cold? Some of the world¡¯s coolest spots happen to be below freezing and have chilling one-of-a-kind experiences you can¡¯t get sitting under a palm tree. From plunging into the icy depths of Iceland¡¯s tectonic plates to partaking in a dog-sled safari, these are some of the best winter travel ideas you should try.

1. Visit the Langjokull ice tunnel

Seeing a glacier from a boat or plane is spectacular, but actually being inside of one is otherworldly. Tours offered by places like Extreme Iceland take an eight-wheel-drive monster truck up to the ice cap of Europe¡¯s second largest glacier where the man-made ice tunnel begins. Inside you¡¯ll chase blue ice and see the heart of a quickly fading natural formation.

2. Retreat to the Japanese slopes

Forget the Rockies or the Alps, Japan is home to some of the most spectacular skiing during the peak season of January to April. Mount Naeba is the place to hit the slopes, known for its powder and world¡¯s longest gondola, which spans the 35-piste terrain. And after a long day in the mountains, you can head to the natural hot springs to soothe sore muscles.
