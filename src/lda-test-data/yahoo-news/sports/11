Thompson: I'm the best shooting guard in NBA

Golden State Warriors star Klay Thompson does not lack confidence, claiming he is the best shooting guard in the NBA.

Thompson is in his fifth season and the 25-year-old already has an NBA ring after helping the Warriors to their first championship since 1975 in July.

And the 2015 All-Star, who is averaging 19.3 points per game this season in a Warriors side that boasts a 26-1 win-loss record, was asked to name the best shooting guard in the league.

And Thompson said via the Bay Area News Group: "I'm going to go with myself. We're 26-1.

"When you play with a free mind and you play thinking you're not hurt and you're healthy, that's when you're playing your best.

"I want to continue playing like this, get better every month."

Thompson was also asked to name the best players in a variety of positions, including point guard.

And there were no surprises as to who he nominated, with Warriors team-mate and reigning NBA MVP Steph Curry given the nod.

"He is one of the greatest, and it's an honour to be in the same backcourt with him," Thompson said.
