NFL playoff picture: Cardinals clinch division, Eagles still alive

Updated standings | AFC | NFC

If the season ended now:

AFC first-round byes: (1) Patriots; (2) Bengals

AFC wild card: (6) Steelers at (3) Broncos; (5) Chiefs at (4) Texans

NFC first-round byes: (1) Panthers; (2) Cardinals

NFC wild card: (6) Vikings at (3) Packers; (5) Seahawks at (4) Redskins

We now know half of the postseason field, but plenty will be decided in the final two weeks of the season.

Despite a 3-7 conference record and a rough 40-17 loss Sunday night, the Philadelphia Eagles would win the NFC East with wins in their last two games, but a loss Saturday to the Washington Redskins would crown Washington the division champion. The New York Giants also have a chance if the Eagles win on Saturday.

The AFC has its own three-team division race in the South, where the Houston Texans took control with a win at the Indianapolis Colts. But a Texans loss would give the Colts another chance and two Texans losses could make the Jacksonville Jaguars division champs at 7-9.

Several teams clinched postseason berths Sunday. The Cincinnati Bengals got in with a win but didn't get the Pittsburgh Steelers loss they needed to win the division. That Steelers win against the Broncos also gives the Kansas City Chiefs a real shot to win the West and possibly drop Denver all the way out of the postseason.

In the NFC, the Green Bay Packers and Seattle Seahawks secured playoff berths, and the Arizona Cardinals assured Seattle of a wild-card spot by clinching the West with a win at night.

Monday's and Thursday's games have no postseason significance, as the Detroit Lions, New Orleans Saints, San Diego Chargers and Oakland Raiders are among the 14 eliminated teams. But Saturday's Redskins-Eagles game looms large.
