Wawrinka has moved on from sledge - Kyrgios

Nick Kyrgios insists Stan Wawrinka has moved on from the Australian's sledge earlier this year, saying it was "almost like nothing happened".

The Australian rising star caused controversy by sledging Wawrinka at the Rogers Cup in August, an incident for which he was fined and received a 28-day suspended sentence.

Wawrinka and Kyrgios are in the same team ¨C the Singapore Slammers ¨C at the International Premier Tennis League.

Kyrgios, 20, said the duo were getting on well.

"We all have a group chat, we¡¯ve all been chatting and I feel like we¡¯re a lot more comfortable with each other now," he told Fox Sports.

"It's almost like nothing happened.

"We're out there competing playing for the same team, we want to win.

"I think that's been the main thing, is me just getting up and giving him the same energy I give everyone else and he¡¯s appreciated that."

Despite the drama, Kyrgios has enjoyed a solid year ¨C rising to 30th in the world rankings.

The two-time grand slam quarter-finalist believes he is playing at close to his highest level.

"I feel as if my game is in its prime at the moment," Kyrgios said.

"I¡¯ve got a massive way to go physically and mentally but I feel as if I can match it with the best in the world."
