Giants LB Connor arrested at Philly airport

Police and team officials say New York Giants linebacker Dan Connor was arrested at Philadelphia International Airport after federal authorities alleged that a switchblade was found in his luggage.

A police spokeswoman said Sunday that a Transportation Security Administration officer spotted the knife on an X-ray machine monitor as Connor was trying to enter an airport terminal at 9 a.m. Saturday.

Police were called and the 27-year-old Connor, of Charlotte, N.C., was arrested and charged with possession of an offensive weapon. The police spokeswoman said he was released on his own recognizance.

Giants spokesman Pat Hanlon said team officials were aware of the situation and have spoken to Connor, ''who is cooperating with the authorities in Philadelphia.''
