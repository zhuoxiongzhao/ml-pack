AZ: Agreement with Sunderland on Altidore transfer

AZ Alkmaar says it has agreed to a deal with Sunderland for the transfer of striker Jozy Altidore to the Premier League club, pending the United States player passing a medical test and agreeing to personal terms.

Last season, Altidore was AZ's top scorer with 23 goals. He has scored 17 times in 60 internationals for the United States.

The 23-year-old forward joined AZ in 2011 from Spanish club Villareal, scoring in his debut and going on to become one of the club's top scorers. He previously played in England for Hull City and has also played for New York Red Bulls, Xerez and Bursaspor.

AZ says on its website it agreed to the transfer Friday, but Sunderland has yet to confirm Altidore's move.
